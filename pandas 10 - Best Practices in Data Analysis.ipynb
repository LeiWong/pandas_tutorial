    "# pandas 10 - Best Practices in Data Analysis\n",

    "This sharing focuses on some best practices I gained during the past years working as a NLP engineer and data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.1 Version control\n",
    "\n",
    "Version conttol is an important practice in software development, and we shall follow this best practice to reduce errors, such as removing code by mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.1 Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is one of the most popular version control tools, and we can find main version control platforms supporting this protocal. We can choose from Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git has many workfolows to follow, we can start with gitflow, which is simple to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../image/gitflow.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.2 Git LFS\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is suitable to store code, but not for big files. Therefore, another version control protocal for big file emerged -- Git LFS. We can use it to store our datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.3 Version control your code, not your data\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of us may used to store temporary / intermediate datasets on harddisk. However, we do not recommend this way; instead, we recommend version contoal your code, and commit as frequent as possible.\n",
    "\n"

    "## 10.2 Folder structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If our code folder is managed by git, it can be an individual folder only for code;\n",
    "2. At the same level, we can have another two folder for raw data and and results. Therefore, we can user git LFS to manage these two folders.\n",
    "3. We can use virtualenv to control the package environment.\n",

    "## 10.3 Jupyter Notebook and IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.3.1 Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Jupyter Notebook is a convinient tool for interacting data analysis.\n",
    "2. We can put code, document, visualisation in a single Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "3. We can experiment / draft / benchmark in Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "4. We can export to markdown / python code / PDF, etc.\n",
    "5. We can install extensions to make Jupyter Notebook easier to use. See [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231?gi=e865fc4d7033).\n",
    "6. All outlines of this course are created with Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.3.2 IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "1. IPython is the backend of Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "2. Jupyter Notebook needs browser support. For example, if we need fix on a server, and we only can access the server via SSH, then IPython is the only choice.\n",
    "3. If you are familiar with Jupyter Notebook, then IPython is farily easy to use."
